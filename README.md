A website that generates simple electrical engineering questions
and grades your answers.

I wrote this in 2009.

Technology
----------

* The code was written in Scala and Java
* The website library was *lift*
* The website ran on Google App Engine
* The repository includes a copy of the source code from JMathLib

This was my first Scala project, so the scala code is surely horrible.
I never used *lift* again, because it turned out to be kind of a bad experience.
However, scala became one of my favorite programming languages.
