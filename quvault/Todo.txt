Next steps:
1	VaultServer: get list of QuParamSpecs for config page
2	rename QuContainerSnippet => QuSnippet
3	question_config: add HTML for <fieldset> etc for the config form
4	QuSnippet: render QuParamSpecs using fieldset/field XHTML structure in question_config.html
	question_config: handle buttons
	question_view: render buttons
	question_view: handle buttons
	external redirect to ThreeResistorCircuit/ if user goes to ThreeResistorCircuit?
	network:
		if there is an element named "Vi", create transfer function variables too
		method to put differential equations into standard form?
		simplify the current divider rule: should be: iA = iABC * ZABC / ZA
	parser: create a parser to support differential equations
		R*C*vC' - vC = V
	RCCircuit:
6		provide the XHTML forms of displayed variables
7		vartable: w, HR, HC, i
		add HR and HC questions
		differential equation (vC')
8		hide nodes "a" and "b" on the network graph
	server:
		how to score differential equations?
			evaluate both sides, subtract them, and see if they are equal to the zero-equation produced by Network given a constant factor
5	networkpainter: means to draw ground in the middle of a wire
	VRC circuit:
		source = DC|sinusoidal|input
		analysis = diffeq, phasors, laplace
		DC:
			multiple choice: choose graph representing curve of vC/vR
			vC(t) = V*(1 - exp(-tau*t))
			vC/dt = ? (or integral?)
			iC/dt = ?
			dvC = ?
			diC = ?
			tau = ?
		sinusoidal:
			question 1: phasor calculations (with possibly lots of variables)
			question 2: phasor equations (single expressions for HC, HR, etc)
			HC =
			HR =
			cutoff = ?
			bode plots
			multiple choice: if C is increased/decreased, what will be the impact on w0?

	parser:
		functions (see http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Simple+tree-based+interpeter)
			exp
			sqrt
			pow
			ln?
			log?
			log10
			log2
		matricies
		matrix range references (i.e., let a single row of an array be set)
		let list of variables be set

	Series/Parallel resistor/capacitor/inductor/voltage/current
	Voltage divider rule
	Current divider rule
	KVL
	KCL
	Ohm's law
	Nodal analysis:
		write the equations
		create the matrix
	Branch analysis
		write the equations
	Equivalent circuits:
		randomly generate a circuit with certain restrictions
		norton equivalent: IN = ?, RN = ?
		thevenin equivalent: Vth = ?, Rth = ?
	Superposition principle
	Network analysis practice (generate random networks for practicing network analysis)
	Complex impedance:
		voltage divider rule
		current divider rule
	Bode Plots:
		show bode plots and ask things like:
			cutoff(s)?
			is this a high-pass or low-pass?
			what is the order of the network (given that only RLC elements are used)?
			does this plot come from an RL, an RC, etc, network?
	RC/RL circuits:
	RLC practice (all possible 3-element RLC circuits, including letting the L or C be non-ideal)
		system of differential equations (vc', iL')
	
	try to replace config View with html+snippets?
	"view/standard/questions/..." => "questions/standard/..." ?
	"view/standard/questions/PT_ThreeResistorCircuit/work?..." => "qs/ee/ThreeResistorCircuit/0-asd3r29asd3r29/work" ?
	
	vault: problemParamsCleanup action
	vault: probset templates
	vault: probsets
	network: simplify equations where direct substitution is possible.  i.e, if iR1 = I, then iR2 = iR2 => iR2 = I
		but more complicated: if iR2 = -I, then iR3 = iR1 + iR2 => iR3 = iR1 - I
		DON'T DO THIS.  I decided against it.  We might as well let the user see how the computer systematically reaches a solution.

Network Painter:
	implement "grid"
	rename *-label => label-* (e.g. left-label => label-left)
	make left/right/top/bottom absolute
	implement rel-left/rel-right/rel-top/rbottom for relative positions
	<grid>
		<resistor row="1" segment="1" left-label="R1"/>
		...
	</grid>
